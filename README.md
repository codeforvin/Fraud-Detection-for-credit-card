# Fraud-Detection-for-credit-card
This project allows users to upload a Jupyter Notebook and a dataset using a Flask web page. The server runs the notebook and shows all the results back on the site. It also includes a complete Credit Card Fraud Detection system that uses SMOTE, ensemble models, and clustering to improve accuracy, along with clear evaluation results.
